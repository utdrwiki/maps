    <property name="description">&quot;To whom it may concern:
After building the first ball puzzle, I realized a fatal flaw in its design.
How was an intruder supposed to like, see it?
The puzzle was on a higher plain, out of your average monster's eyesight.
If someone solved that puzzle, they must be very good at guessing.
In any case, I have created an improved version!
With a new vertical design, you can see what you're controlling!
The parts may still get stuck though.
Please refer to my instructions back at the first puzzle if that happens.
